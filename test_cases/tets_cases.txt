# Hi Xenetian! I want to add a short disclamer before we start.
#
# I intentionally ignored some types of tests, which can be concidered as 
# functional, because the idea of writing specific cases for these 2 pages
# is more about these pages, not web testing in general. 
# So, login testing, cookies testing, HTML and CCR testing will be not 
# mentioned in this document, but I can add them if I misunderstood the 
# main idea.
#
# Formatting: I fully understand, that real test cases should contain much more
# information, like test case numbers, revision or version, priority, pre- and
# postcondidtions, target product versions, some test data, links to documentstion 
# etc. But I tried to make them as simple and readable as possible, since they are 
# not even a real test cases.
# Comments start with "#" obiviously.
#
# Parameters: if exactly the same tests should be executed for different objects, 
# I add all of components as parameters.
#
# Environment: In a perfect world I would strongly recommend to run each test case
# in a several difference browsers (with different resolutions) and on several OSes 
# with difference devices or device emulators/VMs.
# I can add a list of most popular devices/OSes/browsers if it's needed.
#
# Order: tests are sorted by priority from highest to lowest.
#
# So, let's rock!
